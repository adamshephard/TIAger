    Patch extraction is done uniformely on the image surface, by sampling 
    patch_size x patch_size patches from the original image. Paches would have 
    overlap wiith each other.
    inputs:
        img: input image to extract original image size
        patch_size: desired batch size
        overlap: amount of overlap between images
        out_bounds: the scnario of handling patches near the image boundaries
                    - if 'valid' (default), the last vertical/horizontal patch 
                    start position would be changed to fit the image size. Therefore,
                    amount of overlap would be different for that specific patch.
                    - if None, no measure is taken in the bound calculation and probably
                    the image should be be padded to expand sizes before patch extraction.
                In either waym all patches should have size of patch_size.
